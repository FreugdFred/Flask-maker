# Python Flask App Maker

Python Flask App Maker makes your routes and files for your next flask project

## Installation

Download the files, when downloaded open the folder and type the routes you want to create. For example I will create a login route, a logout route a home route and a register route:

```bash
python makeflask.py login logout register home
```

Your flask app is now created in the directory of Flask Maker!

Note: You launch your app straight away, but beacuse ther is no / route it will throw a route not found error, the rest of the routes do work.
